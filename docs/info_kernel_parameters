# Required to enable IPv4 forwarding.
# Redhat users can try setting FORWARD_IPV4 in /etc/syscong/network to true
# Alternatively, it can be set in /etc/sysctl.conf
#

#    echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
#
#    net.ipv4.ip_forward="1"
#

# This enables dynamic address hacking.
# This may help if you have a dynamic IP address \(e.g. slip, ppp, dhcp\).
#

#    echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_dynaddr
#
#    net.ipv4.ip_dynaddr="1"
#

# This enables SYN flood protection.
# The SYN cookies activation allows your system to accept an unlimited
# number of TCP connections while still trying to give reasonable
# service during a denial of service attack.


    echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syncookies

    net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies="1"


# This enables source validation by reversed path according to RFC1812.
# In other words, did the response packet originate from the same interface
# through which the source packet was sent?  It's recommended for single-homed
# systems and routers on stub networks.  Since those are the congurations
# this rewall is designed to support, I turn it on by default.
# Turn it off if you use multiple NICs connected to the same network.


    echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/rp_lter

    net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_lter="1"


# This option allows a subnet to be rewalled with a single IP address.
# It's used to build a DMZ.  Since that's not a focus of this rewall
# script, it's not enabled by default, but is included for reference.
# See: http://www.sjdjweis.com/linux/proxyarp/ 
#

#    echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/proxy_arp
#
#    net.ipv4.conf.all.proxy_arp="1"
#

# The following kernel settings were suggested by Alex Weeks. Thanks!

# This kernel parameter instructs the kernel to ignore all ICMP
# echo requests sent to the broadcast address.  This prevents
# a number of smurfs and similar DoS nasty attacks.


    echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts

    net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts="1"


# This option can be used to accept or refuse source routed
# packets.  It is usually on by default, but is generally
# considered a security risk.  This option turns it off.


    echo "0" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/accept_source_route

    net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route="0"


# This option can disable ICMP redirects.  ICMP redirects
# are generally considered a security risk and shouldn't be
# needed by most systems using this generator.
#

#    echo "0" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/accept_redirects
#
#    net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects="0"
#

# However, we'll ensure the secure_redirects option is on instead.
# This option accepts only from gateways in the default gateways list.


    echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/secure_redirects

    net.ipv4.conf.all.secure_redirects="1"


# This option logs packets from impossible addresses.


    echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/log_martians

    net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians="1"
