# How do I set advanced security options of the TCP/IP stack and virtual memory 
# to improve security and performance of my system? How do I configure Linux 
# kernel to prevent certain kinds of attacks using /etc/sysctl.conf? 
# How do I set Linux kernel parameters?

# sysctl is an interface that allows you to make changes to a running Linux 
# kernel. With /etc/sysctl.conf you can configure various Linux networking and 
# system settings such as:

# 1.   Limit network-transmitted configuration for IPv4
# 2.   Limit network-transmitted configuration for IPv6
# 3.   Turn on execshield protection
# 4.   Prevent against the common 'syn flood attack'
# 5.   Turn on source IP address verification
# 6.   Prevents a cracker from using a spoofing attack against the IP address 
#      of the server.
# 7.   Logs several types of suspicious packets, such as spoofed packets, 
#      source-routed packets, and redirects.
# 8.   ...And many other parameters like cpu setup, file-system setup, etc

# The sysctl command is used to modify kernel parameters at runtime.
# /etc/sysctl.conf is a text file containing sysctl values to be read in and 
# set by sysct at boot time. To view current values, enter:
# sysctl -a
# sysctl -A
# sysctl mib
# sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter
#
# To load settings, enter:
# sysctl -p
